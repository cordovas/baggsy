Baggsy
===========

This is the web component of Baggsy, the subversive graffiti stencil maker, where users are able to find the location in the city of the user initiated stencil.

Baggsy blurs the line between participatory art, graffiti, social activism, and accountability. Baggsy is housed in a grocery paper bag with a false bottom. Erery day a new stencil is loaded up and disbersed among baggsy carriers. The baggsy carriers in turn spread across the city waiting for users to initiate the stencil and become a part of the art making process.
